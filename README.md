## OOPS in Python
* Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects"

### object 
 * Object is a realtime entity i.e

### class
* Blueprint of a object
* It is a logical entity

### methods
* Block of code that perform a particular task

### Inheritance 
* One class can inherit the properties and methods of another class
* In OOPS inheritance provide the idea of reusability. This meand we can add additional features to an existing class without modufying it
